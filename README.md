# Express-coders-game

This game resembles millioners. Initially I did this game from a udemy course (samuraj programowania). 
I wanted to improve this game. So I worked on the front-end side. I also decided to store the data by using mongo db.

Technologies used: node, express, mongo db, ES6, cookies, mongo atlas, heroku

The user has to answer questions. If the user does not the answer he or she can call to a friend, ask the audience or eliminate two of the aswers. 
If the answer is wrong, the game is over.

This application uses mongo db. I decided to create a database on mongo atlas. 
The app can handle multiple users. Every visit invokes user's creation.
In this project the deployment process was aslo important. I had a change to see how cloud solutions work. I did deployment on heroku.
